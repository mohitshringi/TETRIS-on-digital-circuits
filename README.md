# TETRIS-on-digital-circuits
* Implementation of the game of TETRIS on a digital circuit using **Proteus**.
* I actually implemented it for size 10x8 (rows x columns), here I have uploaded a **part of my final** design which I thought would be sufficient to help and build a **TETRIS** game of any size you like.
* I have also attached a video showing the working of my design and me playing the game. Hope it Helps!!!
* **Note** : to simulate the Demo_TETRIS_Game.DSN u need to have Proteus v7. I used v7.8 , the files might not work with other versions.
