# TETRIS-on-digital-circuits
* Implementation of the game of TETRIS on a digital circuit using **Proteus**.
* I actually implemented it for size 10x8 (rows x columns), here I have uploaded a **part of my final** design which I thought would be sufficient to help and build a **TETRIS** game of any size you like.
* I have also attached a video showing the working of my design and me playing the game. Hope it Helps!!!
* 1. **Note** : 
   1.to simulate the Demo_TETRIS_Game.DSN u need to have Proteus v7. I used v7.8 , the files might not work with other versions.
   2. The **column size is fixed as 8 bits** only because the **ROM** used in Proteus reads the **ASCII Value** of each character in the .bin file uploaded into ROM. So each       character in the BIN file is read as a 8-bit ASCII value.
