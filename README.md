# TETRIS-on-digital-circuits
* Implementation of the game of TETRIS on a digital circuit using **Proteus (v7.8)**.
* I actually implemented it for size 10x8 (rows x columns), here I have uploaded a **part of my final** design which I thought would be sufficient to help and build a **TETRIS** game of any size you like.
* I have also attached a video showing the working of my design and me playing the game. Hope it Helps!!!
